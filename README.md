## Predicting Customer Yearly Spending on an E-commerce Platform Using Linear Regression Project Overview

This project aims to predict the yearly spending of e-commerce customers.Using Linear Regression we identify which factors such as time spent on the app,
website usage, session length, and membership duration most strongly influence customer spending.
The analysis helps e-commerce companies understand key drivers of customer value, 
optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer retention.
<br><br>

## Objectives

1- Understand the relationship between different user behaviors and yearly spending.

2- Identify which features are most correlated with higher spending.

3- Build and evaluate a linear regression model to predict Yearly Amount Spent.

4- Assess model performance using standard error metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE).

## Tools and Libraries

Python
<br><br>
Pandas for Data handling and inspection
<br><br>
Seaborn for Matplotlib for Data visualization
<br><br>
Scikit-learn–Model for training and evaluation
<br><br>
NumPy-SciPy for Statistical analysis

<br><br>

## Key Insights
<br><br>
1- App usage is more strongly correlated with spending than website usage.
