## Predicting Customer Yearly Spending on an E-commerce Platform Using Linear Regression Project Overview


This project aims to predict the yearly spending of e-commerce customers . Using Linear Regression we identify which factors such as time spent on the app, website usage, session length, and membership duration
most strongly influence customer spending.The analysis helps e-commerce companies understand key drivers of customer value, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer retention.


## Tools and Libraries

Python
Pandas : Data handling and inspection
Seaborn : Matplotlib for Data visualization
Scikit-learn–Model for training and evaluation
NumPy-SciPy for Statistical analysis


## Key Insights

1- App usage is more strongly correlated with spending than website usage.

2- Length of Membership is the most influential factor — loyal customers tend to spend more.

3- The model can be used to target high-value customers and improve personalized marketing strategies.
