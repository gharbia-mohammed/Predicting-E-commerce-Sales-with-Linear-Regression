## Predicting Customer Yearly Spending on an E-commerce Platform Using Linear Regression Project Overview


This project aims to predict the yearly spending of e-commerce customers . Using Linear Regression we identify which factors such as time spent on the app, website usage, session length, and membership duration
most strongly influence customer spending.The analysis helps e-commerce companies understand key drivers of customer value, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer retention.
